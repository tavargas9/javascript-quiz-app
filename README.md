- To answer a question, the user must simply click on the answer. If correct, a success alert appears. If incorrect, a danger alert appears.
- When either all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0s, the quiz ends and the user is prompted to save their initial and their score.
- At the end of the quiz, and upon click of the "View Highscores" button, the user can look at their current highscores and clear them out if they desire.
